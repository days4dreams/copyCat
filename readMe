CopyCat is a typing game built using C# and Windows Forms in Visual Studio. 

The formâ€™s Timer control adds a random character to the letterBox control every 800 milliseconds, until there are 7 letters displayed (at 7, the game ends).

The user is instructed to type the characters as they appear, as quick as they can. Correct user input clears that character from the letterBox.

A StatusStrip control displays a count of correct and incorrect inputs, an accuracy calculation lets them know how they are doing; see Update() method in Stats class.

An if / else statement within Form1_Keydown is ran each time a user types; the difficulty of the game (the timer interval) is increased as the users keydowns increase, if they match the character correctly.
